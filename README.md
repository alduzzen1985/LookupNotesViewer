# LookupNotesViewer
Lookup Notes Viewer allows you to see all the notes related to a Lookup Field.

You can configure :
	1) Logical name of the Lookup Field 
	2) Date Time Format
	3) Message to display when there aren't notes



Currently you have to bond the Control to a Text Field since is still not possible bond to Lookup Fields.
