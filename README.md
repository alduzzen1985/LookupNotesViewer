# LookupNotesViewer
Lookup Notes Viewer allows you to see all the notes related to a Lookup Field.

You can configure :
<ul>
	<li>Logical name of the Lookup Field </li>
	<li>Date Time Format</li>
	<li>Message to display when there aren't notes</li>

</ul>
	


Currently you have to bond the Control to a Text Field since is still not possible bond to Lookup Fields.
